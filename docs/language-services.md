# Language services

After `edit` or `write` changes a file, `crab` has it formatted as its language
says and adds the errors and warnings found in the files it changed to the
tool's result, at most 20, waiting up to three seconds for them. The tag in the
result is the tag of the formatted file, so the next edit can use it.

The formatting and the diagnostics come from whoever can provide them, and only
one set of language servers runs:

- A client that runs language servers of its own sets `languages` when it opens
  the conversation. `crab` then sends it each request as a `Language` event
  with a ticket, and it answers with a `Language` command under that ticket. A
  request it does not answer in time gets no formatting and no diagnostics.
- Otherwise `crab` starts the usual server of each language itself, when its
  program is installed: `rust-analyzer`, `gopls`, `typescript-language-server`,
  `pyright-langserver` or `pylsp`, `clangd`, `lua-language-server` and `zls`.
  Loading a project can run its build scripts, so a server starts the first
  time a file of its language is written, which the user allowed. In `yolo`
  mode the servers of the languages the project root names (`Cargo.toml`,
  `go.mod`, `package.json` and so on) start when the conversation opens
  instead, so the first write already gets its diagnostics; a server started
  on the first write may still be loading and miss them. A server that stops
  is started again, up to three times. These come from `crates/omc-lsp`, which
  the default `lsp` feature of `omc-session` builds in; a build without it has
  no servers of its own.
- A program that embeds `omc-session` can pass its own
  `omc_tools::LanguageService` in `Options` to `run_with`, and one that builds
  the tools itself can hand `Registry::builtin_in` its own `Languages`.

With none of these, `edit` and `write` behave as they would without language
services.
